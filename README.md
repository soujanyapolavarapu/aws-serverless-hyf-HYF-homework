# HackYourFuture - Serverless in the cloud‚Äù

The purpose of the course is to extend the capabilities and knowledge on how to deliver serverless solutions in the cloud. The course covers services and technologies useful in the areas of web development, data engineering and data science.

It should be noted that these services are not mutual exclusive, i.e storage is used for multiple purposes.

During the course, the solutions created and deployed will also be evaluated from mulitple perspectives. This includes cost, scalability, security, infrastructure and monitoring design perspectives. The programming languges is limited to node.

To get more specific, the students will gain knowledge on how to:

- deploy, host and manage static web applications in the cloud
- create timebased, eventbased and trigger based Lambda functions
- create serverless REST or GraphQL APIs
- create basic but powerful ETL pipelines.

The course will likewise have focus on the ability to discuss, argument and analyze their solutions from core cloud principles (cost, security, infrastrucutre etc.)

Structure is divided as the following:

- 20% : Teacher/Video presentation
- 20% : Student presentation (including feedback)
- 35% : Exercise at class (student groups + teachers + mentors)
- 25% : Exercise at home (student groups + mentors)

## Prerequisites

Basic programming sills or the Javascript module courses offered by HYF.

## Preparation

Materials and guides for each week should be read before class. Mandatory homework exercises should also be completed on a weekly basis.

In addition, small study groups will be asked to present a given topic very briefly (max 5 minutes) at least once throughout the course.

## Environment setup
