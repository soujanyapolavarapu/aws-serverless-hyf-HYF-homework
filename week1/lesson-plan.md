# Week 1 : Course overview and structure

## What is serverless?

> Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model (...). Serverless computing does not hold resources in volatile memory; (...). When an app is not in use, there are no computing resources allocated to the app. (...) However developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, management, maintenance (...).

## Core services and cloud providers

We focus on two cloud providers, namely AWS and Azure.
As for the main serverless services, we will be using the following:

- Lambda / Functions (compute)
- S3 / Blob Storage (storage)
- DynamoDB / Cosmos (databases)

## Assignments and study groups

Each assignment builds upon previous work, but will also have a base template to be used. We reccomend to complete the optional exercises as well, as they will give you an even better feeling of what is possible.

Every class will also have a **very short** (10 minutes and no slides) study group presentation explaining a technology. These will be created in class.

## Setup, deployment and credentials

You will need to prepare an environment with a terminal and workable IDE. We recommend VS Code or similar. We will be using the terminal quite a bit, and operation system does not matter.

You will be given a set of credentials to interact with AWS. These should be kept secret and never be checked into version control (e.g Github). You will likewise be given an account you can use to log into AWS's console website.

The given credentials does not allow you to do everything, and restricts you to only use certain resources and perform certain actions.

You can find the guides for setting up the AWS CLI [in the homework assignment](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-serverless-course/blob/main/week1/homework.md).
